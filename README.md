# Context
This is a Node.js with Express web app that uses football player data from the Telegraph website (https://fantasyfootball.telegraph.co.uk/json/epl/players.json).
It displays the number of points per player per team and the name of the manager of each team is at the top of their team.
Data is stored using the web browser's IndexedDB local storage which means each manager can change their own team's players to see if making a transfer for another player could increase their total points.
The total number of points is given for each team at the top of the web page and updates dynamically when managers change players in their team.
# To run
